    "To model stimulated resonant inelastic X-ray scattering in Co, we use a very simplified model of the Co electronic structure. It is often assumed that the resonant inelastic X-ray scattering and X-ray absorption near the Co L$_3$ resonance can be largely understood in a single active electron approximation, in which a core electron is excited into an unoccupied, delocalized valence band state, and a different electron from a filled, delocalized valence band state fills the core hole. The d-bands in Co are congested near the Fermi level. The unoccupied d-bands give rise to the X-ray absorption seen at the L$_3$ absorption edge of Co, while the occupied d-bands give rise to the X-ray emission.\n",
    "\n",
    "We account for dipolar coupling between core-excited and valence states. We do not, however, account for coupling from a valence state to another valence state or from a core-excited to another core-excited state, as the applied X-ray field is assumed to be far from resonance with these transitions.\n",
