    "We use the model given in [1]. We summarize the equations we need to solve below\n",

    "#### Propagation of X-Ray Field\n",
    "The X-ray pulse propagates in the z-direction and passes through a sample which extends from $z = 0$ to $z = l$. We neglect X-ray and sample dependence in the $x$ or $y$ directions.\n",

    "We assume the coupling of the X-ray pulse to the material can be described with electric dipole interactions, we neglect X-ray-induced coupling of core states to core states or valence states to valence states, and we make the Rotating Wave Approximation. To write the equations for the evolution of the density matrix, we define slowly-varying analogs of the density matrix elements,\n",
